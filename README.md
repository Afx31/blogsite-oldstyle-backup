Forked' backup from my blogsite repo, as I'm taking it in a new direction utilising markdown.

I decided to create this backup as back when I created this I was still in the early stages of my software development studies and was pretty happy where this got to. Instead of the progress getting lost in the primary repo's commit history I thought I'd import that code over to this new repo.
